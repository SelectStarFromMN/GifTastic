# GifTastic

An animated-gif fetching collage application via jquery AJAX calls to the giphy API.  
Some enhancements include: 
    Numeric dropdown control for specifying number of GIFs to fetch (more interactive, very useful control with lots of options).
    Uses localStorage so users don't have to reenter their favorite animals when reloading.
    Random initial-state of loaded GIFs (animated vs still -- less boring).
    Unified "collage" styling which is fairly appealing (better than example imho).
